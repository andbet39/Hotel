A tutorial series from [CODETutorial.io](http://codetutorial.io) .

The tutorial will explain how to create an hotel booking system from scratch using Laravel 5.1  and AngularJS. For this booking engine we will use AngularJS to create a single page application, the front end, where the final user can make reservations and the hotel owner can manage rooms, price and reservations.
